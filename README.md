# TWEET TERMINAL

### REQUIREMENTS

1. Nodejs
2. Twitter Developer Account
3. Twitter Developer App (Enabled to the V2)

### ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

Create a .env as the .env.example shows file in the values
NOTE: API_KEY == CONSUMER_KEY...

`[tweet]: String`

run `node index.js [tweet]`

run `touch ~/.zprofile` to create a profile terminal aliases if you don't already have that created [On Mac]. Create the neccessary file for your OS [".bashprofile", ".profile", ".zshprofile", etc]

Open with a text editor of choice. (Mine being VsCode)

Add -

`alias tweet="node [path_to_file]/index.js $1"`

Running terminal scripts or commands accepts arguments, ignoring [0], you can access from [1] in the form of `$1` and use as above [[Read More](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/use-command-line-arguments-in-bash-script)]
